# Art-Portfolio
First Proper Art Portfolio

This is a documentation on how I made this Website/Portfolio from scratch

Things to note
    I have 0 experience in coding
Lets get started

    1. Find what you want to do 
        a. If your goal is to make a portfolio. Great. 
        b. If not then, not everything will be applicable here. However, you can still learn basics from this
        c. fail fail fail. Many things wont work, but once you get over the hurdle it becomes alot easier.
        d. Do you own research!
            d1. If there is something you want your website to do. Just Youtube, ask AI, Google, Whatever! For example, if you want a cursor on the page to follow your cursor? Google "how to ___ in html and css." 

    2. Find a reference close to your desired outcome. 
        a. Realize that you can change everything about your website. So just try to find something that looks 40% of what you want. and you will basically fill in the blanks, change the colour ETC.

    3. Before you start coding theres a couple things you gotta download before hand.
        a. Create a Github account. If you are a University Student make an account with that email. Just note this will all be  public until you get a website lisense. So DO NOT post anything you wont want a dean to be looking at. If you dont care, make one with your normal email.
        b. download GITHUB Desktop and login
        c. Download Visual Studio Code or VSC for short.
            c1. in VSC download two extensions
            c2. HTML CSS Support 
            c3. A live server extension. to see progross on what others will see eventually.

    4. Github & GITHUB Desktop Summary & Tips
        a. GITHUB is  website where you can both share your code. store your projects, and collaborate with others. 
        b. You can also find others peoples public work, and create a clone and make an altered version for yourself.
            b1. this is good for when you just want to see some stuff, but I wouldnt recommend this if you want to make money and trademark any of your work.
        c. You will take your work from your computer and put it on github from here. and viscerca 

    5. Visual Studio Code VSC Summary & Tips
        a. VSC is where you actually write your code.
        b. Everything here is case sensative 
            b1. TLDR if its not text that you want to appear on the website it should be lowercase.
        c. Comment lots, break your work into chunks so its easily identifiable as to what is what
            c1. for example if you want the title if you page aka the header to be "My Art Portfolio" you should be able to instantly realize where in your code that section is. Understanding your codes whereabouts can go along way when things begin to pile up.
        d. 

    6. Time to do stuff for real
        a. So in GITHUB there will be a few things. 
            a1. first thing you want to do is to make a repository in github deskotop 
                a2. What is a repository? its where your whole file is located. Its the glass that holds your liquid. The liquid being all of your code.
        b. BRANHCES! 
            b1. when you start, a branch will be called main. This is the "live" version of your website. 
            b2. create a second branch in which you will create patches to your website.
        c. Game Analogy.
            c1. Breaking your branches up this way is a good way to make sure everything runs smoothly. 
            c2. For example when you upload your main branch to github thats the live version of a game.
            c3. For the next two weeks youll be coding in your second branch lets say its called "Level1."
            c4. So in two weeks you will post Level1. and this will now be the current patch to your website
            c5. This way if there is a bug that ruins your game you can literally roll back to the patch before. DEcode the new patch and once its fixed upload it again. now without bugs.

    7. Time to start actually coding
        a. Get a basic index.html & styles.css file
            a1. I got mine through CHAT-gpt
            a1. I asked 'give me a simple html, and css file to begin an art portfolio.'
        b. regardless of how you got the file. whether you make it from scratch or not it will be the basis of how you learn 
    
    8. 
        a. for the sake of simplicity I will assume you had the same start as me, and your index.html file has a header, body, footer ETC

    9. Seeing what it looks like
        a. Now assuming you have the correct extensions installed, you should be able to right click on your html file, and click view with live server. This opens your browser and shows you how it looks like if you were to publosh it
        b. You may be thinking "wow this looks horrible" 
            b1. heoever, you must remember that this is just the beginning. Your imagination is the only thing limiting you. Slowly but surely.

    10. THought process
        a. from here on out it is a very self guided way of working. The next steps from here are what I did. my thoughts an basically a diary of what happened and what was i thinking when going into it and while working on it.
        b. if you want to keep reading feel free if not I believe you have the knowledge to work on it by yourself and google your way through it!
        c. Remember failure! you cannot get anywhere without it

    10.5. 
        a. After everyday was done I would update level 1, and once I feel comfortable with it looking somewhat presentable I will take taht to main and create a new branch called level 2. and onwards. I will mention when I change this, but just keep in mind  
    
    11. Day 1. 
        a. We finally have soemthing that we can work with. First thing I thoough was this font and placement of everything is disgisting.
        b. First goal. Center all the main headlining text. 
        c. change the colour of the background and text
        Failed so much, asked myself constantly why isnt this working? then changed a couple thigns, formatted it differently and boom it worked somehow

    12. day 2
        a. center the rest of the text that I coldnt center
        b. Change the font of the header. 
        c. underline the header.
        d. change hte font and sizing of the rest of the text
        e. work on margins and space everyrhting out a little better so its more visually appealing
